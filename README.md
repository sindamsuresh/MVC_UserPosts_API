# MVC_UserPosts_API Call Project

This project demonstrates making API calls and handling JSON data in a Swift iOS app using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Overview

The app fetches user posts from a remote API (JSONPlaceholder) and displays them in a simple user interface. It serves as a basic example of integrating networking and JSON decoding in a Swift iOS app using MVC architecture.

## Features

- **API Call:** Demonstrates how to make a network request to fetch data from a RESTful API.
- **JSON Decoding:** Illustrates how to decode JSON data into Swift model objects.
- **MVC Architecture:** Organizes the code following the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern.
- **Asynchronous Networking:** Handles asynchronous data fetching using `URLSession` and completion handlers.

## Setup

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sindamsuresh/MVC_UserPosts_API.git`
2. Open the Xcode project file.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.

## Usage

Feel free to use this project as a reference or starting point for your own iOS app development. Explore the codebase to understand how API calls, JSON decoding, and MVC architecture are implemented.

## Dependencies
